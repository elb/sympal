## 1.0

### Decoupling

* sfSympalConfig has several methods that aren't tested and maybe shouldn'
  belong in the class:

  * shouldUseResultCache
  * getAssetPath
  * getAdminGeneratorTheme
  * getAdminGeneratorClass

* Test PluginsfSympalContentTable::getContent()

* Look into sfSympalContentRenderer::renderNonHtmlFormats() and sfSympalContent::getFormatData()

### Bug Fixes and Improvements

### Performance

#### Eliminate Joins

* Cache sfSympalContentType data so we do not need to join it on content and menu item queries
* Cache Site record for application and remove Site join from menu and content queries
* Add denormalized cache for list of groups on content record and menu items to avoid m2m joins to retrieve groups

#### Possibilities?

* Test if loading content slots in another query is faster than left joining them in the main query.

### New Documentation Chapters

### I18N

Missing translations:

* "Save Order >>" in nested set editor
* Upgrade module
* Server check
* Most admin generator action titles

## 1.1

* Add enhancement for assets organization. Allow the following: global assets 
for all sites, site specific assets and user assets.
* Make configuration in app.yml allow site specific configuration. May require
making a custom config handler and changing to a sympal.yml
