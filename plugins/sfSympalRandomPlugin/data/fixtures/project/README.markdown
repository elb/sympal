All `*.yml.sample` files in this directory are copied to
`data/fixtures/sympal` when calling `sympal:install`. These are the core
fixtures needed to make sympal work and include the sfGuardDocrinePlugin
groups and permissions built into sympal.

The actual sample content is provided in the `data/fixtures` directory
of individual plugins and are copied to subdirectories of `data/fixtures/sympal`
upon install.
